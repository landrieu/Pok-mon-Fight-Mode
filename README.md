# Pok√©mon-Fight-Mode

Fight mode of Pokemon

My first game realized with SFML, for the course of C++

To run the project you need to install the SFML library on your computer
.

This game is played against a simple IA.

During the first part of the game you have to select your team.
There are 6 Pokemon in each team.
You can not pick two similar Pokemon in your team.

Then the fight starts
You will have to select an action
During this part many elements are considered like the attack, defense or health attribute.
When a Pokemon is K.O another should replace him.
The fight is over when the all team is K.O.
